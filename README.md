# Journey
One of my friends manufactures this thumb cutter product and I decided to build a web page for better reach of his product.

So as a React developer, I took no time deciding that I will use NextJs. The reasons are that website is going to have mostly static content as of now, and with NextJs I can deliver the website fully server-rendered in no time. Tailwind for styling, the hype was real. It provides out-of-the-box support for responsive design. So I went with the tailwind

Then I started thinking about content and design. These were the most challenging part for me as my friend also wasn't very much aware of what to add and how to represent, so I got some images from him and thought about a few stakeholders of this product based on these I created a few pointers.

The next step was designing this content. Representing the product was the most crucial part because representing matters. I found some inspiration online and went with a very minimalistic design. I edited the images to fit in the design and finalized a small description of the product.

Developing a website This was the easiest part for me. In around a few days I completed the website with a responsive design. Not having a designer and a person to provide all small SVG and without designing provided design it was a little painful, but I did it.

Then I stumbled upon the newest thing at that time in my life, It was SEO. How to make the website visible on search engines!! I did some research on my own added a website in Google and added proper meta tags. Slowly it is on the somewhat good index in google searches but it does need more work.



# Development Guide

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This website is build with Nextjs, Typescript and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
